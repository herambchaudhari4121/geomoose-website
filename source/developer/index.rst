Requests for Comments
---------------------

Requests for Comments (RFCs) are proposals guiding the GeoMoose project and software development process.  They must be submitted to the geomoose-users mailing list, publicly debated on the list, then the GeoMoose Project Steering Committee (PSC) votes to determine if they will be officially adopted by the project.
